Let $Y$ be the outcome of interest, $A$ be the (binary, coded as 0 for control and 1 for treatment) treatment, $S$ be the indicator for study participation (so that $S=1$ means that the subject is in the population of the original study, while $S = 0$ means that the subject is in the target population) and $\mathbf{E}$ be effect modifiers. Let $Y^0$ and $Y^1$ be counterfactual outcomes associated with control and treatment, respectively. The primary objective of transportability analysis is to estimate the ATE in the target population:
$$ATE = \E[Y^1 - Y^0 \given S = 0].$$

Simply taking the difference in sample means using the original study data will only unbiasedly estimate the quantity
$$\E[Y \given A = 1, S = 1] - \E[Y \given A = 0, S = 1],$$
which is different from the target ATE due to the different distributions of effect modifiers.

Interpolated g-computation is an adaptation of network meta-interpolation in the meta-analytical context. To this end, we assume that we have aggregate-level data from a randomized clinical trial (RCT), so that no confounding adjustment is necessary. More specifically, suppose that the estimated treatment effect in the original study is $\hat{\Delta}$, and that its estimated standard error is $\hat{\sigma}$. Let $\hat{\Delta}_{ij}$ and $\hat{\sigma}_{ij}$ be the estimated treatment effect and its estimated standard error within level $j = 0,1$ of the $i$th dichotomized effect modifier. Let $p_i$ be the proportion of observations with level 1 of the $i$th effect modifier in the original study sample, and let $p'_i$ be that in the target sample. Finally, let $\rho_{ik}$ be the correlation between the dichotomized effect modifiers $i$ and $k$, estimated from the target data or otherwise specified.
