\usage{
transportGCPreparedModel(
  outcomeModel,
  response = NULL,
  responseLevels = NULL,
  treatment,
  treatmentLevels = NULL,
  family = stats::gaussian,
  method = c("logistic", "probit", "loglog", "cloglog", "cauchit"),
  studyData = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcomeModel}{Either a formula or a \code{glm}, \code{survreg} or \code{coxph} object representing the outcome model.}

\item{response}{String indicating name of response variable. If \code{NULL}, it will be auto-detected from \code{outcomeModel}.}

\item{responseLevels}{For ordinal responses, vector of strings indicating levels of response variable in the study data. If \code{NULL} and \code{polr} is used, it will be auto-detected using \code{response} and \code{studyData}.}

\item{treatment}{String indicating name of treatment variable. This argument is required.}

\item{treatmentLevels}{Vector of strings indicating levels of treatment variable in the study data. If \code{NULL}, it will be auto-detected using \code{treatment} and \code{studyData}.}

\item{family}{Either a family function as used for \code{glm}, or one of \code{c("coxph", "survreg")}. Only required if \code{outcomeModel} is a formula.}

\item{method}{Link function used for \code{polr}, one of \code{c("logistic", "probit", "loglog", "cloglog", "cauchit")}. Only required if \code{outcomeModel} is a formula and \code{polr} is used.}

\item{studyData}{Data frame of the study data.}

\item{wipe}{Logical indicating whether original study data should be wiped from outcome model-fitting object.}
}
\value{
A \code{transportGCPreparedModel} object containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{outcomeModel}: The fitted outcome model with all components containing the data used to fit the model removed
\item \code{response}: String indicating name of response variable
\item \code{treatment}: String indicating name of treatment variable
\item \code{treatmentLevels}: Vector of strings indicating levels of treatment variable
\item \code{family}: The \code{family} argument provided
\item \code{wipe}: The \code{wipe} argument provided
}
}
\description{
An outcome model needs to be fitted using the study data to perform transportability analysis using g-computation. However, \code{glm} and functions in \code{survival} typically contain the data used to fit the model in their respective result objects. This function removes most components containing the data from these result objects to comply with data sharing regulations. The party with sole access to the study data may use only this function and provide the results object (possibly in a .rds file) to others who request it.
